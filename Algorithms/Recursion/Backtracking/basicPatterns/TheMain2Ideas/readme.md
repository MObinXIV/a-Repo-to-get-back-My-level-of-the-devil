# The Main Backtracking patterns

1. First one is normal pick/not pick with left & right recursion calls
2. The second one is repeated pick not pick with loops to generate from 1->n recursion calls.

Both trees goes the first one is the normal left/right work & the second one same idea
but we do from i->n calls for the function
