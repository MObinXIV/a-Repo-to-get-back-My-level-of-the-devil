# This a general notes I observe

- Formula to convert the coordination from 2d to 1d -> row * numCols + col works for converting any 2D array coordinates (row, col) to a 1D array index in a grid with numCols columns.
- Formula to easily count the number of digits in a number ->cnt= int(log10(n)+1)
- Formula to check if the number is power of 2 -> return (n&(n-1))==0;
- sum of n  numbers -> (n+1)/2
- e formula for the sum of cubes of natural numbers.
sum = (n^2 * (n + 1)^2) / 4
